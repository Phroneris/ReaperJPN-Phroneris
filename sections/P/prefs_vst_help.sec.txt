;7C38F4F814A24B35=Directories to scan for VST plug-ins. Subdirectories will be scanned as well.
;8D2AA4413EF31D83=Scan all VST directories for any added or updated plug-ins.
;A33160A83CBD4DE3=Use the generic slider view instead of the VST's custom GUI. You can switch views at any time using the UI button on the plug-in window.
;24C425763A91B75D=Set the default VST knob behavior. Almost no plug-ins support this setting.
062E0C5C05471D20=VST プラグインからオートメーションへの伝達がどのように取り扱われるかを設定します。プラグイン毎に設定を上書きすることもできますが、ほとんどの場合にはデフォルトが最適です。
;2EAA3B50A18F889D=Don't inform VSTis that playback has stopped. Most synths (especially arpeggiators) want to know playback has stopped to avoid hanging notes.
;5709C6930F8F1BE9=Preserve held notes and current pitch when resetting VSTis. This is probably needed when disabling Preferences/Audio/Playback/Reset MIDI CC/Pitch.
;1DE74C0937316C7F=Some VSTs behave differently when rendering offline (not in realtime).  When deselected,  plugins always think they are online.
;FAC0CB28431DC2EC=Some buggy plug-ins crash when the GUI is opened while a different thread is processing audio. This avoids the crash by interrupting audio.
;A91F48CD20B8FDCE=Allow unloading of VST DLLs, which gets them completely out of memory, but also may cause compatibility issues.
;DB1AD925D830A08C=Special mode, applied to UAD plugins only, that reduces parallel processing benefits to avoid UAD-1 crashes.
